          <h3>Stochastic RSI</h3>
          <p>
            The Stochastic RSI (StochRSI) is an indicator that measures the
            strength of price movements relative to recent highs and lows. A
            high value indicates overbought conditions, while a low value
            indicates oversold conditions. A buy signal is generated when the
            StochRSI crosses above 20, and a sell signal is generated when it
            crosses below 80.

          <h3>MACD</h3>
          <p>
            The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a
            trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship
            between two moving averages of a security's price. The MACD is
            calculated by subtracting the 26-day Exponential Moving Average
            (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. A buy signal is generated when the MACD
            line crosses above the signal line, and a sell signal is generated
            when the MACD line crosses below the signal line.

          <h3>MA Cross</h3>
          <p>
            The Moving Average (MA) Cross is a simple technical indicator that
            uses two moving averages to generate buy and sell signals. When the
            short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving
            average, it indicates a buy signal. Conversely, when the short-term
            moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, it
            indicates a sell signal.
